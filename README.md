# **Module 2.1:** 

##Simplex Method

This module focuses on solving maximisation and minimisation problems using Simplex algorithm. 
For example, 
$Ax+By+Cz<=J$

$Dx+Ey+Fz<=K$

Minimise or Maximise $Gx+Hy+Iz$

Simplex method solves this solution using matrix operations or Gaus Jordon Row Elimination.
Simplex method is easy to use for polynomial inequalities and has proven to give accurate results
